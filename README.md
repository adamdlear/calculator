# Calculator Project

## Inspiration
While taking my calculus class, there would be times when I would need a
calculator to help. I tried the native calculator on MacOS but I didn't like
how it didn't show everything I inputted. Oftentimes, the Google calculator
would be my best bet, but I still didn't love it because it lacked some of
the features the Apple one had. Because of this, I wanted to create my
own calculator application that blended the best of these two
apps.

## Process
I was not familiar with Java GUIs, so I thought it'd be best to watch a tutorial
in the beginning. I followed this tutorial (https://youtu.be/dfhmTyRTCSQ?si=rLXqlgIlUZ_T57hr)
to establish a foundation and brush up on my Java at the same time. From there,
I could implement my own custom features. (These features are still in the works.)
