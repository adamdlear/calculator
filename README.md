# Calculator Project

## Inspiration
While taking my calculus class, there would be times when I would need a
calculator to help. I tried the native calculator app on MacOS but it didn't
have everything I was looking for. Often times, the Google calculator would be 
my best bet, but I still didn't love it. Because of this issue, I wanted to
create my own calculator application with keys to my desired specification.

## Process
I was not familiar with Java GUIs, so I thought it'd be best to watch a tutorial
in the beginning. I followed this tutorial (https://youtu.be/dfhmTyRTCSQ?si=rLXqlgIlUZ_T57hr)
to establish a foundation and brush up on my Java at the same time. From there,
I could implement my own custom features. (These features are still in the works.)
